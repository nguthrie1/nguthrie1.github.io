I updated the table first to diplay N/A where null was found. But later had issues with displaying N/A first then ASC later. Will post new code next.
UPDATE public."continent_map" SET country_code = 'N/A' Where country_code IS null ;
select * from public."continent_map" where country_code = 'N/A' ;
select country_code 
from public."continent_map" 
group by country_code 
having count(*)>1 
order by 
case country_code
    when 'N/A' then 0 end ;
