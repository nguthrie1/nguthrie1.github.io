Step 1
What are your favorite books? You can make a database table to store them in! In this first step, create a table to store your list of books. It should have columns for id, name, and rating.
Step 2
Now, add three of your favorite books into the table.
CREATE TABLE  Books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating INTEGER);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (1, "Twilight",7);
INSERT INTO Books VALUES (2, "Prep", 8);
Insert into books values (3, "Their Eyes Are Watching God",6);

SELECT * FROM Books;
