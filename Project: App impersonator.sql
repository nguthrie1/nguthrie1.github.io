"Project: App impersonator" Modifying Databases

Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.


/* What does the app's SQL look like? */
Create table job_board (id Integer PRIMARY KEY, jobname text, month text, companyname text, jobtype text, rank integer);

insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Data Analyst", "May", "Real", "Full Time", 5);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Business Intelligence Specialist", "May", "Apple", "Contract", 3);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Project Manager", "April", "Johnson and Johnson", "Part Time", 4);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Instructional Technology", "June", "Real", "Full Time", 5);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Customer Sucess Manager", "January", "Follet", "Full Time", 3);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Business Development Specialist", "June", "Scholastic", "Full Time", 2);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Data Analyst", "April", "Ziploc", "Part Time", 2);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Data Analyst", "June", "Salesloft", "Full Time", 5);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Graphic Designer", "June", "Canon", "Internship", 1);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Data Analyst Consultant", "June", "Deloitte", "Full Time", 1);
insert into job_board (jobname, month, companyname, jobtype, rank) VALUES ("Data Analyst", "May", "Coder's Data", "Full Time", 2);

update job_board set rank = 1 where id = 7;
select * from job_board;

DELETE FROM job_board where companyname = "Canon";
select * from job_board;
